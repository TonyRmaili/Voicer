In mathematical terms, if you have a number \\( x \\), raising it to the third power is represented as \\( x^3 = x \\times x \\times x \\).\n\nThe specific outcome of cubing a number depends on the value of that number:\n\n1. **If \\( x \\) is positive:** The result will also be a positive number.\n2. **If \\( x \\) is negative:** The result will be negative (since multiplying three negative numbers results in a negative product).\n3. **If \\( x \\) is zero:** The result will be zero (since zero multiplied by any number is zero).\n\nFor example:\n- If \\( x = 2 \\), then \\( 2^3 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 8 \\).\n- If \\( x = -2 \\), then \\( (-2)^3 = -2 \\times -2 \\times -2 = -8 \\).\n- If \\( x = 0 \\), then \\( 0^3 = 0 \\).\n\nIf you provide a specific number, I can show you the result of raising that number to the third power!"

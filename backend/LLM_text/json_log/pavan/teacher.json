Here are the formulas for the area of some common geometric shapes:\n\n1. **Square**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = s^2\n   \\]\n   where \\( s \\) is the length of a side.\n\n2. **Rectangle**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = l \\times w\n   \\]\n   where \\( l \\) is the length and \\( w \\) is the width.\n\n3. **Triangle**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times b \\times h\n   \\]\n   where \\( b \\) is the base and \\( h \\) is the height.\n\n4. **Circle**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\pi r^2\n   \\]\n   where \\( r \\) is the radius.\n\n5. **Parallelogram**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = b \\times h\n   \\]\n   where \\( b \\) is the base and \\( h \\) is the height.\n\n6. **Trapezoid**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (b_1 + b_2) \\times h\n   \\]\n   where \\( b_1 \\) and \\( b_2 \\) are the lengths of the two bases, and \\( h \\) is the height.\n\n7. **Ellipse**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\pi a b\n   \\]\n   where \\( a \\) is the semi-major axis and \\( b \\) is the semi-minor axis.\n\n8. **Sector of a Circle**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\frac{\\theta}{360} \\times \\pi r^2\n   \\]\n   where \\( \\theta \\) is the angle in degrees and \\( r \\) is the radius.\n\nIf you need the area for any other shape, feel free to ask!"

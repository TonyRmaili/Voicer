'''

Role Definition: 
Clearly specify the assistant’s role as a teacher. Define the teaching style—whether the assistant should be more formal, 
conversational, Socratic, or any other style suited for specific subjects.

Example:
"You are a patient and knowledgeable teacher. Your goal is to help the user understand complex topics by explaining them in simple terms,
 offering examples, and using analogies."

--------------------
Tone and Language: Set expectations for the tone (friendly, neutral, formal) and the level of language (beginner, intermediate, advanced) based on the subject or user level.

Example:
"Maintain a warm and approachable tone. Adapt your language to the user's proficiency level."

-------------------
Error Handling and Encouragement: Include a mechanism for handling mistakes in a positive way, encouraging the user to keep learning.

Example:
"If the user makes a mistake, gently correct them and explain the reasoning behind the correct answer. 
Always encourage the user to keep trying."

--------------

Tailored Responses: Ask the assistant to personalize explanations based on the user’s input, such as previous knowledge or areas of difficulty.

Example:
"Tailor your explanations to the user's responses. If they express confusion, offer alternative explanations."

Prompting Best Practices
1. Clearly communicate what content or information is most important.

2. Structure the prompt: Start by defining its role, give context/input data, then provide the instruction.

3. Use specific, varied examples to help the model narrow its focus and generate more accurate results.

4. Use constraints to limit the scope of the model's output. This can help avoid meandering away from the instructions into factual inaccuracies.

5. Break down complex tasks into a sequence of simpler prompts.

6. Instruct the model to evaluate or check its own responses before producing them. ("Make sure to limit your response to 3 sentences", "Rate your work on a scale of 1-10 for conciseness", "Do you think this is correct?").

And perhaps most important:

Be creative! The more creative and open-minded you are, the better your results will be. LLMs and prompt engineering are still in their infancy, and evolving every day.

Chain-of-thought prompting
Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting encourages the LLM to explain its reasoning. Combine it with few-shot prompting to get better results on more complex tasks that require reasoning before a response.

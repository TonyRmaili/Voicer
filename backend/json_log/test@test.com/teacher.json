If you meant \"Raymond\" as a name or term, could you provide more context on what you're referring to? \n\nIf you're asking about \"the remainder\" in a math context, that refers to the amount left over after division when one number does not divide the other evenly. For example:\n\n- In \\( 10 \\div 3 \\), the quotient is 3, and the remainder is 1, because \\( 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\) and \\( 10 - 9 = 1 \\).\n\nPlease clarify, and I'd be happy to help with the information you're looking for!"

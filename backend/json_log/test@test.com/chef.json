        "content": "**Recipe Title:** Classic Lasagna\n\n**Ingredients:**\n- 12 lasagna noodles\n- 1 pound ground beef (or Italian sausage)\n- 2 cups ricotta cheese\n- 1 egg\n- 3 cups marinara sauce\n- 3 cups shredded mozzarella cheese\n- 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese\n- 2 cloves garlic, minced\n- 1 teaspoon dried oregano\n- 1 teaspoon dried basil\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n- Fresh basil for garnish (optional)\n\n**Instructions:**\n1. **Preheat the Oven:** Preheat your oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C).\n   \n2. **Cook the Noodles:** In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook the lasagna noodles according to package instructions until al dente. Drain and lay flat on a clean kitchen towel to prevent sticking.\n\n3. **Prepare the Meat Sauce:** \n   - In a large skillet over medium heat, add the ground beef (or sausage) and cook until browned, about 5-7 minutes. \n   - Drain any excess fat. \n   - Add the minced garlic, oregano, and basil; cook for another 1-2 minutes until fragrant.\n   - Pour in the marinara sauce and simmer for about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste.\n\n4. **Mix Ricotta Filling:** In a bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, egg, a pinch of salt, and a bit of pepper. Mix well until creamy.\n\n5. **Assemble the Lasagna:**\n   - Spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.\n   - Place 3 lasagna noodles on top of the sauce.\n   - Spread half of the ricotta mixture over the noodles, followed by a layer of mozzarella cheese (about 1 cup), and a layer of the meat sauce.\n   - Repeat the layers: noodles, ricotta mixture, mozzarella, and meat sauce.\n   - Top with remaining noodles, the last of the meat sauce, remaining mozzarella, and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.\n\n6. **Bake the Lasagna:** Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil (to prevent sticking, you can spray the foil with cooking spray) and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Then, remove the foil and bake for an additional 15-20 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden.\n\n7. **Cool and Serve:** Allow the lasagna to cool for about 10-15 minutes before cutting. This helps it hold its shape. Garnish with fresh basil if desired.\n\n**Cooking Time and Serving Size:**\n- Total Cooking Time: about 1 hour and 10 minutes (including preparation and baking)\n- Servings: 8\n\n**Notes:**\n- **Variations:** You can add vegetables like spinach, zucchini, or mushrooms for more flavor and nutrition. Just saut\u00e9 them before layering.\n- **Substitutions:** For a vegetarian version, use lentils or a mix of your favorite vegetables instead of meat, and ensure your marinara sauce is meat-free.\n- **Storage:** Lasagna can be made ahead of time and stored in the refrigerator for 1-2 days or frozen for up to 3 months. To reheat, cover with foil and bake at 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C) until heated through. \n\nEnjoy your delicious homemade lasagna! If you have any questions or need further tips, feel free to ask!"

They don\u2019t need to be fully cooked through at this stage, as they will finish cooking in the sauce.\n\n5. **Add the Marinara Sauce:**\n   - Pour the marinara sauce over the meatballs in the skillet.\n   - Cover and simmer for about 15-20 minutes, or until the meatballs are cooked through.\n\n6. **Combine Spaghetti and Sauce:**\n   - Once the meatballs are cooked, you can either serve the sauce and meatballs over the spaghetti or add the cooked spaghetti directly to the skillet and toss to combine.\n\n7. **Serve:** Dish the spaghetti and meatballs onto plates and sprinkle with additional grated Parmesan cheese if desired.\n\n**Cooking Time and Serving Size:**\n- Total Cooking Time: about 30 minutes\n- Servings: 4\n\n**Notes:**\n- **Variations:** You can add herbs like oregano or basil to the meatball mixture for extra flavor. Some people like to mix in some grated onion or shredded mozzarella.\n- **Substitutions:** If you don\u2019t have breadcrumbs, crushed crackers or oats can work as a substitute.\n- **Cooking Tip:** If you have any leftover meat mixture, you can cook it into small patties or add to soups for extra protein!\n\nEnjoy your simple and delicious spaghetti and meatballs!

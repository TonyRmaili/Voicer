Let's solve the equation step by step:\n\nThe equation is:\n\n\\[ 2x + 3 = 11 \\]\n\n**Step 1:** Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \\(x\\):\n\n\\[ 2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3 \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 2x = 8 \\]\n\n**Step 2:** Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \\(x\\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{2x}{2} = \\frac{8}{2} \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[ x = 4 \\]\n\nSo, the solution is:\n\n\\[ x = 4 \\]"
